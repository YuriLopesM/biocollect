## 📘 Description

A mini chemistry project, where students should approach the topic using dynamic methodologies and involving the exchange of ideas between teacher and students. 

For this, my group created a fantasy company (called Biocollect) that offers organic collection routes for members of family farming - in order to put the material in compost and generate biomass and biogas. One of my friends make a 3D model with Blender, and I have the idea to create a simple landing page 👾

## 🎃 Limitations

The premise is to be very simple (created in two nights), and I wanted to do something different to a common grade discipline. So this project doesn't have what a Landing Page normally has:

- Integrations with CMS (But I would like to study Strapi or Prismic someday)
- Mobile and Responsive Design
- SEO
- Animations (In this case, I would probably have used Framer Motion)

and other stuff 🤠
